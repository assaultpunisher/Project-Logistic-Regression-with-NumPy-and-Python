# Project-Logistic-Regression-with-NumPy-and-Python
### Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical analysis method used to predict a data value based on prior observations of a data set. Logistic regression has become an important tool in the discipline of machine learning. The approach allows an algorithm being used in a machine learning application to classify incoming data based on historical data. As more relevant data comes in, the algorithm should get better at predicting classifications within data sets. Logistic regression can also play a role in data preparation activities by allowing data sets to be put into specifically predefined buckets during the extract, transform, load (ETL) process in order to stage the information for analysis.

## Things Done in Project
- Create a function to return model instances
- Data Processing
- Keras model checkpoint callback
- Create and evaluate a new model instance
- Explore the save weights and the save function on model instances
- Use the save weights and the save functions to export to and import from the Saved Model format
