# Project-Logistic-Regression-with-NumPy-and-Python
### Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical analysis method used to predict a data value based on prior observations of a data set. Logistic regression has become an important tool in the discipline of machine learning. The approach allows an algorithm being used in a machine learning application to classify incoming data based on historical data. As more relevant data comes in, the algorithm should get better at predicting classifications within data sets. Logistic regression can also play a role in data preparation activities by allowing data sets to be put into specifically predefined buckets during the extract, transform, load (ETL) process in order to stage the information for analysis.

## Things Done in Project
- Implement the gradient descent algorithm from scratch
- Perform logistic regression with NumPy and Python
- Create data visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
